Steps to publish Git artifacts
A developer should follow these five steps to publish GitHub Actions artifacts for download:
1. Perform Git Actions build steps
2. Create a temporary folder in the container being used
3. Copy all artifacts of interest into that temporary folder
4. Use GitHub’s upload-artifact action
1. Provide a meaningful name for the artifact download link
2. Specify the path to the folder containing your GitHub Action artifacts
5. Run the GitHub Actions workflow and find the published artifacts on the workflow’s
build page
6. The easiest way to demonstrate how GitHub’s artifact upload action works is to add a
step to a simple workflow that creates a temporary directory. Then, use the touch and
echo commands to create a few simple files. Once a developer completes this action, the
files will publish as artifacts.

If a developer isn’t familiar with the echo and output switch, the following command will
create a file on the local filesystem named alpha.html with the text ‘alpha’ contained within
it:
