To provide a comprehensive example, let's create a simple GitHub repository and include a README.md file with instructions on how to install and configure the project. We'll assume this project is a basic Python script.

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in. Then, click on the "New" button to create a new repository. Give your repository a name, add a description if desired, choose visibility options, and click "Create repository."

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the newly created repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store your project. Then, run the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```

3. **Create Project Files:**
   Inside your local repository directory, create your project files. For this example, let's create a Python script (`example.py`) and a README file (`README.md`).

   **example.py:**
   ```python
   # example.py
   def main():
       print("Hello, world!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

   **README.md:**
   ```markdown
   # My Awesome Project

   Welcome to my awesome project! This project does something amazing.

   ## Installation

   1. Make sure you have Python installed.
   2. Clone this repository:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
      ```
   3. Navigate to the project directory:
      ```
      cd your-repository
      ```

   ## Usage

   Run the Python script:
   ```
   python example.py
   ```

   ## Contributing

   Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

   ## License

   [MIT](LICENSE)
   ```

4. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   Add and commit your files using Git, and then push them to your GitHub repository.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add Python script and README"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Verify on GitHub:**
   Visit your GitHub repository page, and you should see your files listed there.

This is a basic example to get you started. Depending on your project's complexity and requirements, you might need to include additional files, such as configuration files, tests, etc. Adjust the instructions in the README file accordingly.
